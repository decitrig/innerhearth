        <div class="class-description" id="yin-yoga">
            <h3 class="class-name">Yin Yoga</h3>
            <p>Yin yoga is a quiet practice where students hold supported postures on the
            floor for longer periods of time to target the connective tissues (ligaments,
            bones, fascia) of the hips, pelvis, spine and shoulders.  It is a wonderful
            compliment to an active lifestyle and appropriate for those who are living with
            chronic pain or injury.  All levels are welcome!
        </div>

            <h3 class="class-name">Yin Yogassage&trade;</h3>
            <p>During a Yin Yogassage class, students of all levels will be led through the
            quiet, reflective practice of Yin Yoga while receiving massage as they rest in
            the poses. Students with chronic conditions are welcome, and will be assisted in
            modifying their practice to accommodate their conditions. Class size is limited,
            insuring that each student receives generous attention.  <strong>Preregistration
                is REQUIRED for Yin Yogassage.</strong>

            <h3 class="class-name">Post-Natal Yoga Series</h3>
            <p>For mothers at least 6 weeks post-partum, and their infants who are not yet
            crawling. Post-Natal yoga focuses on helping new mamas find strength and balance
            in bodies after baby, and promotes healthy attachment and bonding with baby. For
            new mothers, Post-Natal yoga offers a sustained focus on opening areas that grow
            tired from breast- and bottle-feeding, recovering strength and tone in the
            pelvic floor and abdomen, and resting and restoring tired bodies and minds.  The
            practice playfully incorporates baby while teaching mothers the gentle art of
            infant massage.  This series also focuses on building a supportive community of
            new mothers.

    <div>
        <h2 class="teacher-name" id="jill-bio">Jill Cummings (co-owner)</h2>
        <p><span class="teacher-name">Jill Cummings</span> found yoga back in 1999 at the
        12th Street Gym in Philadelphia while seeking a practice to nurture her body after
        years of banging it up as an athlete. A few years later she became certified to
        teach through the thoughtful and compassionate teachings of Corina Benner and Jill
        Manning at Wake Up Yoga. She also completed trainings in kids', prenatal and
        postpartum yoga with Gail Silver of Yoga Child. She's also spiced up her teachings
        by studying Yin yoga with Corina Benner, yoga anatomy with Paul Grilley, Sanskrit
        with Manorama and has practiced with many more amazing teachers.  Jill formerly
        co-founded and taught at Yogawood in Collingswood, NJ until her family relocated to
        Pittsburgh in 2009. While independently teaching the most amazing students in da
        ‘burgh she also co-created Yin YogassageTM with Brad Mumpower in 2011. Jill then met
        Lauren at another local yoga studio…and the rest is history!
        <p>Her teachings are infused with anatomical and physiological considerations ,
        compassion and attention for each unique student , a lot of laughter and tons of
        fun!  When not teaching yoga, Jill is currently finishing her Master of Occupational
        Therapy at the University of Pittsburgh, hanging with her husband and 2 kooky kids,
        goofy hound dog, Charlie and crazy cat, Kitty.

        <h2 class="teacher-name" id="lauren-bio">Lauren Sims (co-owner)</h2>
        <p>In 2004, <span class="teacher-name">Lauren Sims</span> accidentally walked into a
        yoga class instead of a martial arts class and never walked out. Lauren is
        passionate about helping students realize their capacity for growth and change, and
        believes that the most profound possibility yoga offers is the chance to become an
        active, joyful participant in your own life.

        <p>After years of study at Willow Street Yoga in Takoma Park, MD, Lauren graduated
        from their comprehensive teacher training program led by Suzie Hurley and Maria
        Hamburger in 2010. Since then, she's studied therapeutic yoga and anatomy with Jenny
        Otto of Body Balance Yoga, completed a prenatal teacher training with Janice
        Clarfield, and continues to study with master teachers such as Douglas Brooks,

        <h2 class="teacher-name" id="julie-bio">Julie Menge</h2>
        <p><span class="teacher-name">Julie Menge</span> started teaching yoga in 2010 when
        she completed her 200 hour teacher training in the style of vinyasa yoga. After much
        soul searching, Julie left her career in human resources to teach yoga full-time and
        hasn't looked back since. She hopes that you will walk away from her classes with
        strength, calmness, and a sense of empowerment regarding your practice, your life,
        and the decisions you make on and off the mat. Julie has also studied and teaches
        yin yoga.  She loves encouraging her vinyasa students to check out the "other half
        of their yoga practice" and try a yin class!

        <p>Julie's classes are mainly influenced by Seane Corn (after completing a teacher
        training intensive with her in 2012), as well as the many incredibly talented local
        teachers in Pittsburgh.  As of January 2013, she is also enrolled in a YogaWorks
        teacher training program to continue her yoga education. Julie lives in Wilkinsburg
        with her husband Nate and their rescued dogs, Chelsea and Buzz.

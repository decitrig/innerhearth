                    <p><strong>Inner Hearth Yoga</strong> is the place to stoke up your yoga
                    practice alongside the Point Breeze community! Whether you're a novice or a
                    longtime practitioner, our skilled and attentive teachers at the Hearth will
                    meet you where you are. Don't worry about having the right outfit, the best
                    attitude, or the perfect pose. Inner Hearth's yoga is for every body!</p>

                    <p>Our teachers help students recognize their bodies' potential through precise
                    but compassionate instruction, and supply the anatomical context students need
                    to make empowered choices about their yoga practice.</p>

                    <p>Our classroom opens 15 minutes before class begins. We're on the second floor

                        Reynolds Street</a> in Point Breeze, above Make Your Mark Artspace and
                    Coffeehouse. Street parking is available for free.</p>

                    <p>If you visit our studio after Make Your Mark Coffeehouse is closed, please
                    use the <strong>outside</strong> staircase only. If Make Your Mark is open during your visit,
                    you're welcome to use the stairs inside the coffeehouse!</p>

                    <p>If you have your own yoga mat, please bring it! We have some mats available
                    for your use (no charge, they're free), but a yoga mat is a good investment for
                    your health and home practice. We have straps, blocks, blankets and bolsters for
                    you to use.</p>

                    <p><span class="teacher-name">Julie Menge</span> started teaching yoga in 2010 when
                    she completed her 200 hour teacher training in the style of vinyasa yoga. After much
                    soul searching, Julie left her career in human resources to teach yoga full-time and
                    hasn't looked back since. She hopes that you will walk away from her classes with
                    strength, calmness, and a sense of empowerment regarding your practice, your life,
                    and the decisions you make on and off the mat. Julie has also studied and teaches
                    yin yoga.  She loves encouraging her vinyasa students to check out the "other half
                    of their yoga practice" and try a yin class!</p>

                    <p>Julie's classes are mainly influenced by Seane Corn (after completing a teacher
                    training intensive with her in 2012), as well as the many incredibly talented local
                    teachers in Pittsburgh.  As of January 2013, she is also enrolled in a YogaWorks
                    teacher training program to continue her yoga education. Julie lives in Wilkinsburg
                    with her husband Nate and their rescued dogs, Chelsea and Buzz.</p>

                    <p>In 2004, <span class="teacher-name">Lauren Sims</span> accidentally walked into
                    a yoga class instead of a martial arts class and never walked out. Lauren is
                    passionate about helping students realize their innate capacity for growth and
                    change, and believes that the most profound possibility yoga offers is the
                    chance to become an active, joyful participant in your own life.</p>

                    <p>After years of study at Willow Street Yoga in Takoma Park, MD, Lauren
                    graduated from their comprehensive teacher training program led by Suzie Hurley
                    and Maria Hamburger in 2010. Since then, she's studied therapeutic yoga and
                    anatomy with Jenny Otto of Body Balance Yoga, completed a prenatal teacher
                    training with Janice Clarfield, and continues to study with master teachers such
                    as Douglas Brooks, Christina Sell, Sally Kempton, Zhenja LaRosa, and Martin
                    Kirk. Her classes aspire to allow the body to reach its full potential through
                    mindful sequencing and precise instruction, and are infused with warmth, humor,
                    and just a bit of tough love!</p>

                    <p>Lauren moved to Pittsburgh in June 2012, and fell in love with the City of
                    Steel at first sight. She lives in Shadyside with her husband and two entitled
                    cats.</p>

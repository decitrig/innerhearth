                    <p>Our teachers help students recognize their bodies' potential through precise

                    <p>Our classroom opens 15 minutes before class begins. We're on the second floor
                    at <a

                        Reynolds Street</a> in Point Breeze, above Make Your Mark Artspace and
                    Coffeehouse. Street parking is available for free.</p>

                    <p>If you visit our studio after Make Your Mark Coffeehouse is closed, please
                    use the <strong>outside</strong> staircase only. If Make Your Mark is open during your visit,
                    you're welcome to use the stairs inside the coffeehouse!</p>

                    <p>If you have your own yoga mat, please bring it! We have some mats available
                    for your use (no charge, they're free), but a yoga mat is a good investment for
                    your health and home practice. We have straps, blocks, blankets and bolsters for
                    you to use.</p>

                        <p>Yin yoga is a quiet practice where students hold supported postures on
                        the floor for longer periods of time to target the connective tissues
                        (ligaments, bones, fascia) of the hips, pelvis, spine and shoulders.  It is
                        a wonderful compliment to an active lifestyle and appropriate for those who
                        are living with chronic pain or injury.  All levels are welcome!</p>

                        <p>For mothers at least 6 weeks post-partum, and their infants who are not
                        yet crawling.   Post-Natal yoga focuses on helping new mamas find strength
                        and balance in bodies after baby, and promotes healthy attachment and
                        bonding with baby. For new mothers, Post-Natal yoga offers a sustained focus
                        on opening areas that grow tired from breast- and bottle-feeding, recovering
                        strength and tone in the pelvic floor and abdomen, and resting and restoring
                        tired bodies and minds. The practice playfully incorporates baby while
                        teaching mothers the gentle art of infant massage.  This series also focuses
                        on building a supportive community of new mothers.</p>

                    <p><span class="teacher-name">Jill Cummings</span> found yoga back in 1999 at the
                    12th Street Gym in Philadelphia while seeking a practice to nurture her body
                    after years of banging it up as an athlete. A few years later she became
                    certified to teach through the thoughtful and compassionate teachings of Corina
                    Benner and Jill Manning at Wake Up Yoga. She also completed trainings in kids',
                    prenatal and postpartum yoga with Gail Silver of Yoga Child. She's also spiced
                    up her teachings by studying Yin yoga with Corina Benner, yoga anatomy with Paul
                    Grilley, Sanskrit with Manorama and has practiced with many more amazing
                    teachers.  Jill formerly co-founded and taught at Yogawood in Collingswood, NJ
                    until her family relocated to Pittsburgh in 2009. While independently teaching
                    the most amazing students in da ‘burgh she also co-created Yin YogassageTM with
                    Brad Mumpower in 2011. Jill then met Lauren at another local yoga studio…and the
                    rest is history!</p>
                    <p>Her teachings are infused with anatomical and
                    physiological considerations , compassion and attention for each unique student
                    , a lot of laughter and tons of fun!  When not teaching yoga, Jill is currently
                    finishing her Master of Occupational Therapy at the University of Pittsburgh,

                    <p>In 2004, <span class="teacher-name">Lauren Sims</span> accidentally walked into
                    a yoga class instead of a martial arts class and never walked out. Lauren is
                    passionate about helping students realize their capacity for growth and
                    change, and believes that the most profound possibility yoga offers is the
                    chance to become an active, joyful participant in your own life.</p>

                    <p>After years of study at Willow Street Yoga in Takoma Park, MD, Lauren
                    graduated from their comprehensive teacher training program led by Suzie Hurley
                    and Maria Hamburger in 2010. Since then, she's studied therapeutic yoga and
                    anatomy with Jenny Otto of Body Balance Yoga, completed a prenatal teacher
                    training with Janice Clarfield, and continues to study with master teachers such
                    as Douglas Brooks, Christina Sell, Bernadette Birney, and Emma Magenta. Her
                    classes inspire the body to reach its full potential through mindful sequencing
                    and precise instruction, and are infused with warmth, humor, and just a bit of
                    tough love!</p>

                    <p>Lauren moved to Pittsburgh in June 2012, and fell in love with the City of
                    Steel at first sight. She lives in Shadyside with her husband and two entitled
                    cats.</p>

                    <p><span class="teacher-name">Julie Menge</span> started teaching yoga in 2010 when
                    she completed her 200 hour teacher training in the style of vinyasa yoga. After much
                    soul searching, Julie left her career in human resources to teach yoga full-time and
                    hasn't looked back since. She hopes that you will walk away from her classes with
                    strength, calmness, and a sense of empowerment regarding your practice, your life,
                    and the decisions you make on and off the mat. Julie has also studied and teaches
                    yin yoga.  She loves encouraging her vinyasa students to check out the "other half
                    of their yoga practice" and try a yin class!</p>

                    <p>Julie's classes are mainly influenced by Seane Corn (after completing a teacher
                    training intensive with her in 2012), as well as the many incredibly talented local
                    teachers in Pittsburgh.  As of January 2013, she is also enrolled in a YogaWorks
                    teacher training program to continue her yoga education. Julie lives in Wilkinsburg
                    with her husband Nate and their rescued dogs, Chelsea and Buzz.</p>

    <h2>Making Up Missed Classes</h2>

    <p>Going to a weekly class is great - it helps make yoga practice a regular part of your life -
    but sometimes you need to miss a class or two. When this happens, you have until the end of the
    session to MAKE UP your missed classes! If you know you’re going to miss class in advance, you
    can even make up BEFORE you miss class.</p>

    <p>Many people enjoy taking class on alternate days of the week - for example, register for one
    class a week and attend class on alternate Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>

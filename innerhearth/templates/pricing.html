  <h2>Making Up Missed Classes</h2>

  <p>Going to a weekly class is great - it helps make yoga practice a regular part of your life -
    but sometimes you need to miss a class or two. When this happens, you have until the end of the
    session to MAKE UP your missed classes! If you know youâ€™re going to miss class in advance, you
    can even make up BEFORE you miss class.</p>

  <p>Many people enjoy taking class on alternate days of the week - for example, register for one
    class a week and attend class on alternate Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>

        <p>In 2004, <span class="teacher-name">Lauren Sims</span> accidentally walked into a
        yoga class instead of a martial arts class and never walked out. Lauren is
        passionate about helping students realize their capacity for growth and change, and
        believes that the most profound possibility yoga offers is the chance to become an
        active, joyful participant in your own life.

        <p>After years of study at Willow Street Yoga in Takoma Park, MD, Lauren graduated
        from their comprehensive teacher training program led by Suzie Hurley and Maria
        Hamburger in 2010. Since then, she's studied therapeutic yoga and anatomy with Jenny
        Otto of Body Balance Yoga, completed a prenatal teacher training with Janice
        Clarfield, and continues to study with master teachers such as Douglas Brooks,

        reach its full potential through mindful sequencing and precise instruction, and are
        infused with warmth, humor, and just a bit of tough love!

        at first sight. She lives in Shadyside with her husband and two entitled cats.

      <p>
	Max found yoga in 2001 soon after moving to Pittsburgh from Italy. After many years of hard
	core mountain biking, his knees decided they needed some TLC. After a few physical therapy
	sessions it was suggested he try yoga to keep his legs in shape and to stretch his
	muscles. Then, after 6 months of yoga classes at the local gym Max starting noticing how
	much better he felt after each class. This is when the light bulb went off in his brain and
	his journey truly began.
      </p>
      <p>
	Max currently has a weekly home practice and practices with some of his favorite teachers
	including; Jill Cummings, Richard Gartner, Maggie Pietri- Boria and Alana Deloge. He has
	enjoyed attended workshops with Kino McGregor, Doug Keller and other esteemed teachers.

	he was finally able to make the time for yoga teacher training.  He is attending the
	YogaWorks 200-hour teacher training with Anna Gilbert Zupon at BYS. He is projected to
	complete the training in July 2013.

      <h2 class="teacher-name">Laura Stamm</h2>
      <img class="teacher-headshot" src="images/laura-stamm-headshot.jpg" alt="Laura Stamm" />
      <p>Laura began practicing in 2007 completely unaware of how yoga
        would change her body, mind, and outlook on life. After
        several years, she decided that she wanted to help others find
        the strength, flexibility, and space to breathe she found on
        and off her mat. Laura recently completed her 200 hour
        YogaWorks Teacher Training with Anna Gilbert Zupon at BYS.
        Laura’s classes are primarily alignment-based Vinyasa, drawing
        from her mixed personal practice of Ashtanga, Iyengar, and
        Vinyasa yoga. She seeks to teach an all-levels class —
        accessible to beginners, but also challenging for intermediate
        practitioners — with attention paid to the needs of each
        student.</p>

      <p>When not practicing or teaching yoga, Laura is working on her PhD in
        Film Studies. Or hanging out in Frick Park with her dog, Willow.</p>

      <h2 class="teacher-name">Stefanie Zito</h2>
      <img class="teacher-headshot" src="images/stefanie-zito-headshot.jpg" alt="Stefanie Zito" />
      <p>Stefanie's journey of joy and exploration through movement began initially with a
        hula-hoop. It wasn't long thereafter that she began to explore other forms of mindful
        movement and fell in love with yoga. These two practices continue to teach her so much about
        how we live, move, and interact with the world. Stefanie completed her 200 hour YogaWorks
        Teacher Training with Anna Gilbert Zupon at BYS in 2012. She values a come-as-you-are
        approach to the mat, employing both mindful sequencing and clear instruction with a dash of
        playfulness. Stefanie's primary goal is to offer a safe and engaging space for each student
        to be on the mat, while learning to infuse movement with breath, in search of stability,
        softness, and new space within the body and mind.</p>

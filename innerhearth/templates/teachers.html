        <p>Jill Cummings found yoga back in 1999 at the 12th Street Gym in Philadelphia while seeking
          a practice to nurture her body after years of banging it up as an athlete. A few years later
          she became certified to teach through the thoughtful and compassionate teachings of Corina
          Benner and Jill Manning at Wake Up Yoga. She also completed trainings in kids', prenatal and
          postpartum yoga with Gail Silver of Yoga Child. She's also spiced up her teachings by
          studying Yin yoga with Corina Benner, yoga anatomy with Paul Grilley, Sanskrit with Manorama
          and has practiced with many more amazing teachers.  Jill formerly co-founded and taught at
          Yogawood in Collingswood, NJ until her family relocated to Pittsburgh in 2009. While
          independently teaching the most amazing students in da ‘burgh she also co-created Yin
          YogassageTM with Brad Mumpower in 2011. Jill then met Lauren at another local yoga
          studio…and the rest is history!</p>
        <p>Her teachings are infused with anatomical and physiological considerations, compassion and
          attention for each unique student , a lot of laughter and tons of fun!  When not teaching
          yoga, Jill is currently finishing her Master of Occupational Therapy at the University of
          Pittsburgh, hanging with her husband and 2 kooky kids, goofy hound dog, Charlie and crazy
          cat, Kitty.</p>

        <p>In 2004, Lauren Sims accidentally walked into a yoga class instead of a martial arts class
          and never walked out. Lauren is passionate about helping students realize their capacity for
          growth and change, and believes that the most profound possibility yoga offers is the chance
          to become an active, joyful participant in your own life.</p>

        <p>After years of study at Willow Street Yoga in Takoma Park, MD, Lauren graduated from their
          comprehensive teacher training program led by Suzie Hurley and Maria Hamburger in
          2010. Since then, she's studied therapeutic yoga and anatomy with Jenny Otto of Body Balance
          Yoga, completed a prenatal teacher training with Janice Clarfield, and continues to study
          with master teachers such as Douglas Brooks, Christina Sell, Bernadette Birney, and Emma
          Magenta. Her classes inspire the body to reach its full potential through mindful sequencing
          and precise instruction, and are infused with warmth, humor, and just a bit of tough love!</p>

        <p>Lauren moved to Pittsburgh in June 2012, and fell in love with the City of Steel at first
          sight. She lives in Shadyside with her husband and two entitled cats.</p>

        <p>Julie Menge started teaching yoga in 2010 when she completed a 200-hour teacher training
          in the style of vinyasa yoga. After much soul searching, Julie left her career in human
          resources to teach yoga full-time and hasn't looked back since. Today, her classes are infused
          with humor, alignment, rhythmic flow, and a steady balance between effort and ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Julie has also studied and teaches yin yoga. She loves encouraging her vinyasa students to
          check out the "other half of their yoga practice" and try a yin class!
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, Julie completed a second 200-hour training with YogaWorks, under the guidance of
          Anna Gilbert Zupon. Julie now considers her classes to be mainly influenced by the YogaWorks
          philosophy of teaching thoughtful, alignment based flow. She also is greatly inspired by
          Seane Corn, and travels the U.S. to try and practice with her at least once a year. Finally,
          Julie's most important teachers are the totally awesome local yoga teachers right here in
          Pittsburgh, PA!

        <p>
          Max found yoga in 2001 soon after moving to Pittsburgh from Italy. After many years of hard
          core mountain biking, his knees decided they needed some TLC. After a few physical therapy
          sessions it was suggested he try yoga to keep his legs in shape and to stretch his
          muscles. Then, after 6 months of yoga classes at the local gym Max starting noticing how
          much better he felt after each class. This is when the light bulb went off in his brain and
          his journey truly began.
        </p>
        <p>
          Max currently has a weekly home practice and practices with some of his favorite teachers
          including; Jill Cummings, Richard Gartner, Maggie Pietri- Boria and Alana Deloge. He has
          enjoyed attended workshops with Kino McGregor, Doug Keller and other esteemed teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          After couple of years of careful time management and planning (thanks to his wife Jennifer),
          he was finally able to make the time for yoga teacher training.  He is attending the
          YogaWorks 200-hour teacher training with Anna Gilbert Zupon at BYS. He is projected to
          complete the training in July 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not on his mat, you can find him at his day job as a software engineer at the University
          of Pittsburgh, riding is mountain bike all around the ‘burgh, tasting good wines and delicious food,
          cooking, reading, and last but most important, spending time with his wife Jennifer and two sons
          Alessandro and Roberto.

        <p>Maggie completed her first vinyasa teacher training in 2010, shortly after graduating from
          college. In 2012, she went on to complete her 200 hour training with Chrissy Carter at
          YogaWorks NYC. Maggie teaches an alignment-based class with fluid, yet intuitive
          sequences. She uses humor to lighten the effortful moments, and as a reminder to stay
          grounded in the present moment. Maggie is personally committed to creating a sustainable
          practice grounded in ahimsa (compassion or non-harming) and svadhyaya
          (self-reflection). When she’s not teaching, Maggie works as an actor both onstage and more
          recently, onscreen.</p>

        <p>Stefanie's journey of joy and exploration through movement began initially with a
          hula-hoop. It wasn't long thereafter that she began to explore other forms of mindful
          movement and fell in love with yoga. These two practices continue to teach her so much about
          how we live, move, and interact with the world. Stefanie completed her 200 hour YogaWorks
          Teacher Training with Anna Gilbert Zupon at BYS in 2012. She values a come-as-you-are
          approach to the mat, employing both mindful sequencing and clear instruction with a dash of
          playfulness. Stefanie's primary goal is to offer a safe and engaging space for each student
          to be on the mat, while learning to infuse movement with breath, in search of stability,
          softness, and new space within the body and mind.</p>

modality called Reiki. Reiki has been defined as "universal energy", and will be offered mindfully
by Jill Cummings as she guides you through a practice designed to help you relax and rejuvenate.</p>

<p>Effects of Reiki are said to include deep relaxation and an increased sense of calm and
well-being. Join Jill for this two hour long treat, and see what an evening of mindful relaxation
can unlock for you!</p>

<p>Take time this holiday season to rest, and in doing so, lend a helping hand to members of our
community who are in upheaval during this time. 100% of the proceeds from this workshop will go to
the Adopt a Family program at the Women's Shelter, which helps women and their families to maintain
a sense of self and autonomy while they're transitioning out of harmful situations. In return,
you'll be treated to two blissful hours of candle-lit restoratives, reminding you that no matter
your situation, a rested body is a gift beyond price!</p>

<h1>Winter Solstice Practice</h1>
<p><b>Saturday, December 21</b> from <b>3-5pm</b> with Jill &amp; Lauren</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 1em">

</div>

<p>On the shortest day of the year, take refuge at Inner Hearth to pause and reflect. Our practice,
from 3-5pm, will start in the light and end in the dark as we welcome the contemplative time of
winter and set an intention for the new year to come.</p>

<p>All are welcome at this practice! We'll start with several rounds of sun salutations to
acknowledge the setting sun, and continue with soothing restorative and Yin Yoga poses as the
evening settles in. We'll close with a long meditation to seal our intentions for the return of the
sun.</p>

<p>All Levels Welcome!</p>
<p>$20.00</p>

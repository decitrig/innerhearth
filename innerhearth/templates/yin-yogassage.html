    Yin Yogassage is a seamless blend of yoga and bodywork. During a Yin Yogassage class,
    students of all levels will be led through the quiet, reflective practice of Yin Yoga while
    receiving massage as they rest in the poses. Students with chronic conditions are welcome,
    and will be assisted in modifying their practice to accommodate their conditions. Class size
    is limited, insuring that each student receives generous attention! Experience for yourself
    the deep release of tension and complete relaxation that occurs during a Yin Yogassage
    workshop.

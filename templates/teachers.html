        <img class="teacher-headshot" src="images/jill-headshot.jpg" alt="Jill Cummings" />
        <p><span class="teacher-name">Jill Cummings</span> found yoga back in 1999 at the
        12th Street Gym in Philadelphia while seeking a practice to nurture her body after
        years of banging it up as an athlete. A few years later she became certified to
        teach through the thoughtful and compassionate teachings of Corina Benner and Jill
        Manning at Wake Up Yoga. She also completed trainings in kids', prenatal and
        postpartum yoga with Gail Silver of Yoga Child. She's also spiced up her teachings
        by studying Yin yoga with Corina Benner, yoga anatomy with Paul Grilley, Sanskrit
        with Manorama and has practiced with many more amazing teachers.  Jill formerly
        co-founded and taught at Yogawood in Collingswood, NJ until her family relocated to
        Pittsburgh in 2009. While independently teaching the most amazing students in da
        ‘burgh she also co-created Yin YogassageTM with Brad Mumpower in 2011. Jill then met
        Lauren at another local yoga studio…and the rest is history!
        <p>Her teachings are infused with anatomical and physiological considerations ,
        compassion and attention for each unique student , a lot of laughter and tons of
        fun!  When not teaching yoga, Jill is currently finishing her Master of Occupational
        Therapy at the University of Pittsburgh, hanging with her husband and 2 kooky kids,
        goofy hound dog, Charlie and crazy cat, Kitty.

        <img class="teacher-headshot" src="images/lauren-headshot.jpg" alt="Lauren Sims" />
        <p>In 2004, <span class="teacher-name">Lauren Sims</span> accidentally walked into a
        yoga class instead of a martial arts class and never walked out. Lauren is
        passionate about helping students realize their capacity for growth and change, and
        believes that the most profound possibility yoga offers is the chance to become an
        active, joyful participant in your own life.

        <p>After years of study at Willow Street Yoga in Takoma Park, MD, Lauren graduated
        from their comprehensive teacher training program led by Suzie Hurley and Maria
        Hamburger in 2010. Since then, she's studied therapeutic yoga and anatomy with Jenny
        Otto of Body Balance Yoga, completed a prenatal teacher training with Janice
        Clarfield, and continues to study with master teachers such as Douglas Brooks,
        Christina Sell, Bernadette Birney, and Emma Magenta. Her classes inspire the body to
        reach its full potential through mindful sequencing and precise instruction, and are
        infused with warmth, humor, and just a bit of tough love!

        <p>Lauren moved to Pittsburgh in June 2012, and fell in love with the City of Steel
        at first sight. She lives in Shadyside with her husband and two entitled cats.

      <p><span class="teacher-name">Kim Eckel</span>first turned to yoga in the late 90s to
	complement her time spent running competitively in college. It did not take long for her to
	discover the wonderful peace that can come through practice and in 2006, she completed her
	200 hour certification at Kripalu. Kim aims to cultivate compassionate self-awareness among
	her students, as well as an appreciation for the equanimity that can be found through
	practice on the mat. Her classes vary depending on the needs of her students; however, she
	continually seeks to provide a safe, fun and relaxing environment. When not practicing yoga
	or running, Kim can be found working on her PhD and enjoying time with her husband and son.</p>

        12th Street Gym in Philadelphia while seeking a practice to nurture her body after
        years of banging it up as an athlete. A few years later she became certified to
        teach through the thoughtful and compassionate teachings of Corina Benner and Jill
        Manning at Wake Up Yoga. She also completed trainings in kids', prenatal and
        postpartum yoga with Gail Silver of Yoga Child. She's also spiced up her teachings
        by studying Yin yoga with Corina Benner, yoga anatomy with Paul Grilley, Sanskrit
        with Manorama and has practiced with many more amazing teachers.  Jill formerly
        co-founded and taught at Yogawood in Collingswood, NJ until her family relocated to
        Pittsburgh in 2009. While independently teaching the most amazing students in da
        ‘burgh she also co-created Yin YogassageTM with Brad Mumpower in 2011. Jill then met
        Lauren at another local yoga studio…and the rest is history!
        <p>Her teachings are infused with anatomical and physiological considerations ,
        compassion and attention for each unique student , a lot of laughter and tons of
        fun!  When not teaching yoga, Jill is currently finishing her Master of Occupational

        <p>In 2004, <span class="teacher-name">Lauren Sims</span> accidentally walked into a
        yoga class instead of a martial arts class and never walked out. Lauren is
        passionate about helping students realize their capacity for growth and change, and
        believes that the most profound possibility yoga offers is the chance to become an
        active, joyful participant in your own life.

        <p>After years of study at Willow Street Yoga in Takoma Park, MD, Lauren graduated
        from their comprehensive teacher training program led by Suzie Hurley and Maria
        Hamburger in 2010. Since then, she's studied therapeutic yoga and anatomy with Jenny
        Otto of Body Balance Yoga, completed a prenatal teacher training with Janice
        Clarfield, and continues to study with master teachers such as Douglas Brooks,
        Christina Sell, Bernadette Birney, and Emma Magenta. Her classes inspire the body to
        reach its full potential through mindful sequencing and precise instruction, and are
        infused with warmth, humor, and just a bit of tough love!

        <p>Lauren moved to Pittsburgh in June 2012, and fell in love with the City of Steel
        at first sight. She lives in Shadyside with her husband and two entitled cats.

      <p>
	Julie Menge started teaching yoga in 2010 when she completed a 200-hour teacher training in
	the style of vinyasa yoga. After much soul searching, Julie left her career in human
	resources to teach yoga full-time and hasn't looked back since. Today, her classes are
	infused with humor, alignment, rhythmic flow, and a steady balance between effort and
	ease.
      </p>
      <p>
	Julie has also studied and teaches yin yoga. She loves encouraging her vinyasa students to
	check out the "other half of their yoga practice" and try a yin class!
      </p>
      <p>
	In 2013, Julie completed a second 200-hour training with YogaWorks, under the guidance of
	Anna Gilbert Zupon. Julie now considers her classes to be mainly influenced by the YogaWorks
	philosophy of teaching thoughtful, alignment based flow. She also is greatly inspired by
	Seane Corn, and travels the U.S. to try and practice with her at least once a year. Finally,
	Julie's most important teachers are the totally awesome local yoga teachers right here in
	Pittsburgh, PA!
      </p>
      <p>
	You can find Julie hanging out with her husband Nate, and their two rescued dogs Chelsea and
	Buzz in their Wilkinsburg townhouse.

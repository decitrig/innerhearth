<p>Think you need to be an acrobat to stand on your hands? Think again! Come learn the anatomy of
the arm balance and get in touch with how to stabilize your shoulder girdle, engage your core and
lighten your hips so you can feel confident and grounded while balancing on your hands.</p>

<p>This practice is open to all students who've tried some arm balances and want further support and
instruction to grow their practice. Contact Jill at info@innerhearthyoga.com for more info.</p>

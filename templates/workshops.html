<h1>Chakra Vinyasa Adventure</h1>

</div>

<p>
This 2 hour workshop will begin with a short discussion on the chakras - 7 energy points that
correspond to physical locations in the body. Where are they located and what does each represent?
</p>

<p>
The heart of the workshop is a vinyasa flow class suitable for all levels. We will work our way
through each of the chakras from the bottom up, practicing postures to stimulate and energize each
chakra. In each posture, you will learn characteristics of an excessive or deficient chakra, how it
is relevant to you personally, and ultimately begin to bridge the gap between the mind and physical
body.
<p>

<p>
We will wrap up with discussion and activities to further discover which chakras are energized,
which are deficient, and what can we do about all of it!
</p>

<p><b>All levels welcome!</b></p>

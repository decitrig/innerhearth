well-being. Join Jill for this two hour long treat, and see what an evening of mindful relaxation

<p>
Carpal tunnel symptoms - tingling in the fingers, pain in the wrists, shoulders and neck - can feel
debilitating, but by incorporating daily mindfulness and simple movement into our lives, we can
learn not only to get by, but to thrive! Join Jill & Lauren for an afternoon of anatomy, trigger
point self-massage and asana. Open to everyone with issues in neck, shoulders, or wrists - that is,
open to ALL!

<h1>Winter Solstice Practice</h1>
<p><b>Saturday, December 21</b> from <b>3-5pm</b> with Jill &amp; Lauren</p>

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 1em">

</div>

<p>On the shortest day of the year, take refuge at Inner Hearth to pause and reflect. Our practice,
from 3-5pm, will start in the light and end in the dark as we welcome the contemplative time of
winter and set an intention for the new year to come.</p>

<p>All are welcome at this practice! We'll start with several rounds of sun salutations to
acknowledge the setting sun, and continue with soothing restorative and Yin Yoga poses as the
evening settles in. We'll close with a long meditation to seal our intentions for the return of the
sun.</p>

<p>All Levels Welcome!</p>
<p>$20.00</p>
